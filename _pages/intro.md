I am a PhD candidate in Learning Sciences Program at Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology, McGill University. My research interest is to investigate and understand how educational apps aimed at young children are designed and created; through studying the pedagogical approaches app developers use to design their apps and comparing how these approaches are manifested in the actual apps. <a href='https://tlclab.owlstown.net'>Technology, Learning, & Cognition Lab</a>.
